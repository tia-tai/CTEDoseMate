**What’s DoseMate™?**

DoseMate™ is a transformative product that dispenses medication on a set customizable schedule that is personal to you. No pre-prepping pills throughout the week, just dump them into DoseMate™, set the schedule, listen out for an alarm, and live your life.

**Why DoseMate™?**

If you or family or friends experience memory loss, DoseMate™ can help. Older individuals can have independence while their family can have peace of mind knowing they’ll be taken care of.

User Interface:
Users interact with the device via an LCD screen, rotary encoder, and a button.

Mechanism:
When the time comes up, the ESP will run the servo of the red size selector to the designated size. Then, another servo will rotate the blue pill holder to the right pill slot. Then, after the pill falls out, the buzzer will beep to alert the user. Finally, the servos spin in the opposite direction, until the reset button is pressed, fully resetting the machine.
